## Developer guide

So you want to contribute code to this project? Excellent! We're glad you're here. Here's what you need to do.

### Forking and Cloning

Fork this repository on GitHub, and clone locally with `git clone`.

### Install Prerequisites

You will need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in your environment to properly pull down dependencies to build and bootstrap the plugin.

### Environment Setup

1. Download OpenSearch for the version that matches the [OpenSearch Dashboards version specified in package.json](./package.json#L7).
2. Download and install the appropriate [Anomaly Detection OpenSearch Plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection).
3. Download the OpenSearch Dashboards source code for the [version specified in package.json](./package.json#L7) you want to set up.

   See the [OpenSearch Dashboards contributing guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for more instructions on setting up your development environment.

4. Change your node version to the version specified in `.node-version` inside the OpenSearch Dashboards root directory (this can be done with the `nvm use` command).
5. Create a `plugins` directory inside the OpenSearch Dashboards source code directory, if `plugins` directory doesn't exist.
6. Check out this package from version control into the `plugins` directory.
7. Run `yarn osd bootstrap` inside `OpenSearch-Dashboards/plugins/anomaly-detection-dashboards-plugin`.

Ultimately, your directory structure should look like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
.
├── OpenSearch-Dashboards
│   └──plugins
│      └── anomaly-detection-dashboards-plugin
```

### Build

To build the plugin's distributable zip simply run `yarn build`.

Example output: `./build/anomaly-detection-dashboards-1.0.0.0.zip`

### Run

In the base OpenSearch Dashboards directory, run

- `yarn start --no-base-path`

  Starts OpenSearch Dashboards and includes this plugin. OpenSearch Dashboards will be available on `localhost:5601`.

### Test

- `yarn test:jest`

  Runs the plugin unit tests.

- `yarn test:e2e`

  Start OpenSearch Dashboards, wait for it to be available on `localhost:5601`, and runs end-to-end tests.

- `yarn cy:run`

  Runs end-to-end tests on a currently running OpenSearch Dashboards server. Defaults to run the tests on `localhost:5601`, although you can change this to run on any
  OpenSearch Dashboards server with the command `yarn cy:run --config baseUrl=<your-custom-URL>`
