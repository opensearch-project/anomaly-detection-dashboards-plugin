## OpenSearch Anomaly Detection Dashboards Plugin

The OpenSearch Anomaly Detection Dashboards plugin enables you to leverage Machine Learning based algorithms to automatically detect anomalies as your log data is ingested. Combined with [Alerting](https://opensearch.org/docs/monitoring-plugins/alerting), you can monitor your data in near real time and automatically send alert notifications. With an intuitive OpenSearch Dashboards interface and a powerful API, it is easy to set up, tune, and monitor your anomaly detectors.

Anomaly detection uses the Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm for detecting anomalous data points.

You should use the plugin with the same version of the [OpenSearch Alerting Dashboards Plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting-dashboards-plugin). You can also create monitors based on a created anomaly detector. A scheduled monitor run checks the anomaly detection results regularly and collects anomalies to trigger alerts based on custom trigger conditions.
